# Handel

Handel is a fast multi-signature aggregation protocol for large Byzantine
committees. This is the reference implementation in Go.

You can find the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fL0mBF5At4ojW0HhbvBQ2yJHA3_q8q8kiioC6WvY9g4/edit?usp=sharing) presented at [Stanford Blockchain Conference 2019](https://cyber.stanford.edu/sbc19).

Most development is done in the `dev` branch and a first release will be released in Q1 2019.

In the meantime, you can check the `HACKING.md` file to know more about the generic interface used to plug Handel over different networks, curves, and topology.
