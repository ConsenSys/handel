Graph:
For 99% threshold:
Time to reach objective for various number of nodes <= that’s imprecise but right
On the same graph: min max avg
Same for 75% threshold
Same for 51% threshold

Then same data organized by threshold

Same configuration, but packet received

Number of dead nodes:
 For 3000 nodes, time to reach a threshold 51% with
99% live nodes: time when all nodes have 51% of the signatures
75% live nodes: time when all nodes have 51% of the signatures
51% live nodes: time when all nodes have 51% of the signatures


Number of signatures checked on avg per node
For 500  nodes, then 1000, then 3000  <= that’s precise but wrong
